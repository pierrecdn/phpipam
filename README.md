## How to use this Docker image

### Mysql

Run a MySQL database, dedicated to phpipam.

```bash
$ docker run --name phpipam-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -v /my_dir/phpipam:/var/lib/mysql -d mysql:5.6
```

Here, we store data on the host system under `/my_dir/phpipam` and use a specific root password.

### Phpipam

```bash
$ docker run -ti -d -p 80:80 -e MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw --name ipam --link phpipam-mysql:mysql pierrecdn/phpipam
```

We are linking the two containers and exposing the HTTP port.

### First install scenario

* Browse to `http://<ip>[:<specific_port>]/install/`
* Step 1 : Choose 'Automatic database installation'

* Step 2 : Re-Enter connection information

![step2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4225738/8746789/0ad367e2-2c8d-11e5-80bb-f5093801e139.png)

* Note that these two first steps could be swapped by patching phpipam (see https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam/issues/25)
* Step 3 : Configure the admin user password

* You're done !

### Docker compose

You can also create an all-in-one YAML deployment descriptor with Docker compose, like this:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.6
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
  ipam:
    depends_on:
      - mysql
    image: pierrecdn/phpipam
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_USER=root
      - MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw
      - MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_HOST=mysql
    ports:
      - "80:80"
volumes:
  db_data:
```

And next :

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

You can also point the `MYSQL_ENV_PASSWORD_FILE` environment variable to a file,
in which case the contents of this file will be used as the password.
This makes it possible to use docker secrets for instance:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  ipam:
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/phpipam_mysql_root_password
    secrets:
      - phpipam_mysql_root_password
```

The secret can be created by running `echo my-secret-pw | docker secret create phpipam_mysql_root_password -`

### Advanced Configuration

Here is the list of the available environment variables in the phpipam container, pass them to docker using `-e`.
None of them are actually needed to run the container, this is only to tweak the behavior.

| Environment variable           | Default value | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ |:-------------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_HOST           | mysql         | The host used to reach the MySQL instance                                                                |
| MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_USER           | root          | The user to connect the MySQL instance                                                                   |
| MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD  | (empty)       | The MySQL password. Can be set using the Web UI during the first install                                 |
| MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_DB             | phpipam       | The name of the MySQL DB to connect to                                                                   |
| MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE  | (empty)       | A file containing the password (if not using MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD) this allows to leverage docker secrets |
| PHPIPAM_BASE                   | /             | The base URI under which phpipam runs. Useful when performing rewrites with a reverse-proxy              |
| GMAPS_API KEY                  | (empty)       | Google Maps API Key, used to display maps of your devices                                                |
| GMAPS_API_GEOCODE_KEY          | (empty)       | Google Maps Geocode API Key, used to find coordinates from an address/ a location of your device         |

### Specific integration (HTTPS, multi-host containers, etc.)

Regarding your requirements and docker setup, you've to expose resources.

For HTTPS, run a reverse-proxy in front of your phpipam container and link it to.

For multi-host containers, expose ports, run etcd or consul to make service discovery works etc.

### Notes

phpIPAM is under heavy development by the amazing Miha.
To upgrade the release version, just change the `PHPIPAM_VERSION` environment variable to the target release (see [here](https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam/releases)).
